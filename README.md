# Iris Flower Species Classification

## Problem Statement
A botanical research centre wants to automate Iris flower species identification
using machine learning instead of manual measurements.

## Dataset Description
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target)

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

## Approach
- Label Encoding
- Model training
- Performance comparison using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
Logistic Regression performed best with 100% accuracy on the Iris dataset.

## Note
The Iris dataset is small, clean, and balanced. High accuracy is expected and may
not represent real-world performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
